# webgl-owu-logo
This project uses WebGL to render a 3D "OWU” logo, with each letter ("O", "W", and "U") spinning independently around its own axis. The user can interactively resize the logo using a slider and shift its horizontal position using "Walk Left" and "Walk Right" buttons. Each letter is built using custom 3D geometry and colored with red fronts, black backs, and white sides.
